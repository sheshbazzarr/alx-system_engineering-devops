# **0x0F-load_balancer**

- ## what is a load balancer 
	- Load balancing is` the method of distributing network traffic equally across a pool of resources that support an application`. Modern applications must process millions of users simultaneously and return the correct text, videos, images, and other data to each user in a fast and reliable manner. 
	- a load balancer is `a device that sits between the user and the server group and acts as an invisible facilitator , ensuring that all resouce servers are used equally.`

## what are the benefits fo load balancing ?
Load balancing directs and controls internet traffic between the application servers and their visitors or clients. As a result, it improves an applicationâ€™s availability, scalability, security, and performance.

### Application availablity 
 - Server failure or maintenance can increase application downtime, making your application unavailable to visitors. Load balancers increase the fault tolerance of your systems by automatically detecting server problems and redirecting client traffic to available servers.  You can use load balancing to make these tasks easier:
	- Run application server maintenance or upgrades without application downtime
	- provide automatic disaster recovery to backup sites
	- perform health checks and prevent issues that can cause downtime
### Application scalablity
You can use load balancers to direct network traffic intelligently among multiple servers. Your applications can handle thousands of client requests because load balancing does the following:
	- prevents trafic bottlenecks at any one server
	- predicts application traffic so that you can add or remove differnt servers, if needed
	- adds redundancy to your system so that you can scale with confidence
### Application security
Load balancers come with built-in security features to add another layer of security to your internet applications. They are a useful tool to deal with distributed denial of service attacks, in which attackers flood an application server with millions of concurrent requests that cause server failure. Load balancers can also do the following:
 	- Monitor traffic and block malicious content
	- Automatically redirect attack traffic to multiple backend servers to minimize impact
	- Route traffic through a group of network firwalls for additional security 
### Application performance
Load balancers improve application performance by increasing response time and reducing network latency. They perform several critical tasks such as the following:
	- Distribute the load evenly between servers to improve application performance
	- Redirect client requests to a geographically closer server to reduce latency
	- Ensure the reliability and performance of physical and virtual computing resources
### what are load balancing algorithms ?
[200~A load balancing algorithm is the set of rules that a load balancer follows to determine the best server for each of the different client requests. Load balancing algorithms fall into two main categories.
